# Testing Task 02: Systems (60% Marks)

### Problem Description

You have two files located on two different Linux servers. Initially, both files are identical, but over time, updates are made to either file independently. The requirement is to ensure that changes made to one file are automatically replicated to the other file, and this synchronization should occur in both directionsâ€”whenever either file is updated, the changes should be reflected in the other file.

---

## 1. Problem Assessment

To design a professional and reliable solution to keep the files synchronized across two servers, we need to consider several factors, including synchronization triggers, network reliability, conflict resolution, and fault tolerance.

### High-Level Assessment of Requirements and Potential Challenges

**Requirements:**

1. **Bidirectional Synchronization**  
   Any change made to File A on Server A should be reflected in File B on Server B, and vice versa. This synchronization must happen every time a file is updated.

2. **Real-Time Updates**  
   Changes should be propagated either in real-time (immediately after they happen).

3. **Conflict Resolution**  
   In case both files are updated simultaneously, there should be a strategy to resolve conflicts. For instance, either the latest update wins, or a version control system may be employed.

4. **Reliability**  
   The solution should be resilient to network failures or server downtimes. If synchronization fails due to connectivity issues, the system should retry when the connection is restored.

5. **Scalability**  
   While the current scenario involves two files on two servers, the solution should be scalable to accommodate more files or additional servers if needed in the future.

6. **Minimal Resource Usage**  
   The synchronization process should have a minimal performance impact on both servers, using appropriate strategies to minimize bandwidth and processing power (e.g., syncing only the changes rather than the entire file).

Before implementing a solution from scratch or reinventing the wheel, research was conducted on available tools that meet these requirements. After researching, the following tools were found to be capable of achieving these requirements:

- **rsync & inotify**  
  Refer to native man pages.

- **Unison & inotify**  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison)

- **Syncthing**  
  [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)

## 3. Comparison of Syncthing, Unison with inotify, and rsync with inotify for Bidirectional File Synchronization


### **1. rsync with inotify**

**Overview:**
`rsync` is a widely used utility for synchronizing files between systems, known for its efficiency in transferring only the differences between files. `inotify` is a Linux kernel subsystem that monitors file system events.

**Assessment:**

- **Bidirectional Synchronization:**
  - *Challenge:* `rsync` is inherently unidirectional. Achieving bidirectional synchronization requires setting up scripts on both servers to monitor changes and trigger `rsync` commands to the opposite server.
  - *Impact:* Increases complexity and potential for synchronization conflicts.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - *Implementation:* Using `inotify`, scripts can be configured to trigger `rsync` immediately upon detecting file changes.
  - *Limitation:* Potential latency between detection and synchronization, especially under heavy load.

- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - *Challenge:* Lacks built-in conflict resolution. Simultaneous edits can lead to overwriting changes.
  - *Workaround:* Requires additional scripting or manual intervention to handle conflicts.

- **Reliability:**
  - *Concern:* No inherent retry mechanism for network failures. Scripts must handle exceptions and implement retries.
  - *Impact:* Increases complexity and potential for unsynchronized states during outages.

- **Scalability:**
  - *Limitation:* Managing multiple servers and files increases script complexity exponentially.
  - *Maintenance:* Becomes cumbersome with the addition of more files or servers.

- **Minimal Resource Usage:**
  - *Advantage:* Efficient in data transfer due to delta encoding.
  - *Concern:* Continuous monitoring and frequent synchronization can increase CPU and network usage.

### **2. Unison with inotify**

**Overview:**
Unison is a synchronization tool designed for bidirectional file syncing. It ensures consistency between directories on different hosts.

**Assessment:**

- **Bidirectional Synchronization:**
  - *Strength:* Built-in support for bidirectional synchronization.
  - *Benefit:* Automatically detects and synchronizes changes on both servers.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - *Implementation:* Can be triggered using `inotify` to run Unison upon file changes.
  - *Limitation:* Not originally designed for real-time syncing; may experience slight delays.

- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - *Strength:* Provides robust conflict detection and resolution options.
  - *Customization:* Allows configuration for automatic conflict resolution or user prompts.

- **Reliability:**
  - *Strength:* Handles interrupted synchronizations gracefully.
  - *Concern:* Requires additional scripting to handle network failures and retries when using `inotify`.

- **Scalability:**
  - *Limitation:* Configuration becomes complex with multiple files or servers.
  - *Maintenance:* Each new node requires careful setup to ensure consistency.

- **Minimal Resource Usage:**
  - *Concern:* Resource-intensive when scanning large directories.
